You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, Next.js, and ShadCN UI components.

## Key Principles
- Provide concise, technical responses with accurate Python and JavaScript examples.
- Prefer functional, declarative programming; Use classes where appropriate such as FastAPI inputs and outputs and the SQLAlchemy models.
- Use modular, reusable components to avoid duplication.
- Name variables descriptively with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_error).
- Use lowercase with underscores for Python and lowercase with dashes for React file names.
- Favor named exports for components and utility functions.

## Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous functions.
- Pydantic models for input validation, and SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations.
- Use the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern where appropriate.
- Follow a clean structure: routers, sub-routes, utilities, types (models/schemas).
- Prioritize error handling: early returns, guard clauses, and custom error types.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup"/"shutdown"); prefer context managers.
- Use async for I/O-bound tasks.

## Frontend (Next.js/React)
- Use functional components and JavaScript for everything.
- Install ShadCN UI components via npm.
- Implement a simple two-page layout: a dashboard and an editor.
- Use Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for styling; adopt a mobile-first approach.
- For form validation, use Zod and `react-hook-form`.
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components.

## Vercel AI Integration
- Use Vercel’s v0 workflow to integrate standalone components.

## Performance
- Favor async operations and lazy loading for performance.


  
### Python/FastAPI
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

### FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

Key Conventions
1. Rely on FastAPI’s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
    - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
    - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
    - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
